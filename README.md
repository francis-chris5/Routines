# Routines
An upcoming piece of software, not quite ready yet...

(about three hours in so far)


I just can't seem to find the project management software I really want, so I'm going to make it. The problem is such software is set up for massive undertakings and tasks can rarely be scheduled for less than a day, and those that do have hours seem to glitch out at such short time scales. I want to use gantt charts when planning my classroom lectures is what I'm looking for.


So the idea here is a task app beefed up with some project management tools.

add tasks to a routines to-do list, with an estimated start time or predecessor, and length.
"calendar" can range from minutes to years fills automatically from estimated start time and lengths

assign resources to tasks: people, funds, "labor" -an estimate of how hard it will be (exhausted makes next task harder)-,...


get a gantt chart, pie charts for task and resource percentage, pert chart, work breakdown, ...
