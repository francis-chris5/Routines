# Routines


<h2>Intro</h2>

I just could not seem to find the project management software I really wanted, so I finally got around to just making it myself. The problem is project management software is set up for massive undertakings and tasks can rarely be scheduled for less than a day, and those that do have minutes and hours seem to glitch out at such short time scales. What I'm looking for is something that will allow me to use gantt charts and \<difficulty\> or \<complexity\> level resources when planning out my lectures for the classroom or other presentations. While I'm at it I might as well go ahead and make it usable for regular project management work as well.

<h2>Installation</h2>
The project is made with JavaFX which means that to run it requires a Java Runtime Enviroment as well as the JavaFX-sdk. The launcher scripts take care of that, but if you prefer the installers are ready and in the directory called "Installers", just download the appropriate one for your machine and run it: windows -double click it, linux -in terminal enter <b>sudo dpkg -i Routines_1.1.2_amd64.deb</b>, and for mac -double click it (I have not yet given the apple store $99 so a security warning will show, go to "System Preferences --> Security & Privacy --> General Tab to run anway if you want to). To download and run the source simply click github's green "Code" button and download the zip file, after unzipping it navigate into the top-level "Routines" folder and run the appropriate launcher for your system (.bat for Windows and .sh for Linux, .zsh for Mac). Obviously all of this is assuming your machine already has java installed (JRE 8 or higher). If the javafx dependencies are not present when running from the source files it will download them -so it should only happen the first time the application is launched.

The "Routines" folder also contains the test run project (a .rtne file) used in the images shown below if you go with the source code route.
