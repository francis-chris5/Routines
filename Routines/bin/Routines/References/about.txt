Most project management software seems to be intended for huge projects and kind of glitches out on small time-scales: particularly minutes.

I teach software development courses and like to use Gantt, PERT, and Resource Usage charts (with costs representing complexity or exhaustion levels) when planning my lectures. I finally got around to making the project management software I needed, but tried to keep it in line with the 'standards' for such software in case other people may find it useful.
