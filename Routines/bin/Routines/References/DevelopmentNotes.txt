when building switch location of how to get files to read
    Routine Controller
        -location of stylesheet in changeTheme()
    HelpDialog
        -in the constructor, 


remove version number from fxml (I'm using 11 not 16) to stop that warning
    opening tag of top level element



after building in netbeans move 
    (NetbeansProjects -> Routines -> Build -> Classes -> routines )
    folder of class files and all other resources to a folder named 
    bin at same level as launcher file (put on github like this)
