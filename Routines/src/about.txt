So the idea here is a task app beefed up with some project management tools.

add tasks to a routines to-do list, with an estimated start time or predecessor, and length.
"calendar" can range from minutes to years fills automatically from estimated start time and lengths

assign resources to tasks: people, funds, "labor" -an estimate of how hard it will be (exhausted makes next task harder)-,...


get a gantt chart, pie charts for task and resource percentage, pert chart, work breakdown, ...
