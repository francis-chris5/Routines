ROUTINE:

    The Routines Application will open to an empty routine

    Clicking the Routine Details Button will bring up the Routine Details Dialog, selecting [File -> New] from the main menu in order to create a new routine will open directly to the Routine Details Dialog, or selecting [File -> Routine Details] from the main menu will open the Routine Dialog: 
        Enter a name for the routine --NOTE: the name of the routine is different than the filename where it will be saved to allow versioning of a routine--
        Choose one of the Timescale Radio Buttons to set the default Timescale task durations will be measured in --NOTE: this can easily be overridden per-task--
        Enter the projected/anticipated/allocated budget for the project
        Use the date selector to choose the desired/anticipated/projected Start Date for the routine
        The "Notes" text area is for general note keeping on a routine-wide basis
            Overriding the default usage of the Enter key to confirm the Dialog entry seemed a slippery slope so use Shift+Enter for line feeds in the notes
            This is an HTML editor, not text editor, so it is better to type the words and then format them

    A summary of the routine details will appear as the label for the Routine Details Button
    
    To edit any of the Routine Details simply relaunch the Routine Details Dialog by clicking the Routine Details Button

        Provide the cost for the resource and select one of the radio buttons to determine the Cost Basis of how the cost will be applied to the routine
        Move the slider to an appropriate Stamina value for the current resource: the resource stamina will be compared to task complexity as a ratio (and its inverse) to use in the Routine Analysis Procedures --for example a warning message if back to back high complexity tasks are assigned to a resource known to "tire easily"
        Use the Date Picker to add requested days off for the current resource, right click a date on the list to remove it
        All details for a resource are optional fields

        assign resources to the task, and select a complexity level for the current task
